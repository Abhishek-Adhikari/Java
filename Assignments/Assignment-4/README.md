# Difference Between AWT and Swing

## Definition
AWT is a collection of GUI components (widgets) and other related services required for GUI programming in Java. Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create Java-based Front end GUI applications. Hence, this explains the main difference between AWT and Swing in Java.

## Type
AWT components are heavyweight while Swing components are lightweight.

## Platform Dependency
Another major difference between AWT and Swing in Java is that AWT is platform dependent while Swing is platform independent.

## Display
Moreover, AWT does not support a pluggable look and feel. Swing supports a pluggable look and feel. This is also an important difference between AWT and Swing in Java.

## Components
Also, Swing has more advanced components than AWT.

## Speed
Furthermore, execution of AWT is slower. However, Swing executes faster.

## MVC
AWT does not support MVC pattern while Swing supports MVC pattern. This is another difference between AWT and Swing.

## Memory Space
Moreover, AWT components require more memory space while Swing components do not require much memory space.

## Package
The programmer has to import the javax.awt package to develop an AWT-based GUI. However, the programmer has to import javax.swing package to write a Swing application.

## Conclusion
``` In brief, AWT and Swing are two toolkits to build rich Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). The main difference between AWT and Swing in Java is that AWT is Javaâ€™s original platform dependent windowing, graphics and user interface widget toolkit while Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for Java that is an extension of AWT. ```
