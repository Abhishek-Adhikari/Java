# Constructors

Note that the constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have a return type (like void).

Also note that the constructor is called when the object is created.

All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, Java creates one for you. However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.

## Constructor Types

- Default Constructor
- Parameterized Constructor
- Copy Constructor

# Stack using array
Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
- Push: Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
- Pop: Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
- Peek or Top: Returns the top element of the stack.
- isEmpty: Returns true if the stack is empty, else false

# Uses of abstract class in java

Java Abstract class can implement interfaces without even providing the implementation of interface methods. Java Abstract class is used to provide common method implementation to all the subclasses or to provide default implementation. We can run abstract class in java like any other class if it has main() method.
## Constructor Types

- Default Constructor
- Parameterized Constructor
- Copy Constructor

# Multiple inheritance in java
The only way to implement multiple inheritance is to implement multiple interfaces in a class. In java, one class can implements two or more interfaces. This also does not cause any ambiguity because all methods declared in interfaces are implemented in class.

```bash Note:
Java doesnâ€™t support Multiple Inheritance

# Usage of superclass
- Super variables refer to the variable of a variable of the parent class.
- Super() invokes the constructor of immediate parent class.
- Super refers to the method of the parent class.


# Final 
Final is a keyword in Java that is used to restrict the user and can be used in many respects. Final can be used with:

- Class
- Methods
- Variables

# Static keyword
The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

The static can be:
- Variable (also known as a class variable)
- Method (also known as a class method)
- Block
- Nested class
